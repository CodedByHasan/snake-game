![Github Workflow](https://github.com/codedByHasan/snake-game/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg)

## Getting Started

> Note: It is assumed you are in the . directory.

It is recommend to run python applications in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). To do so, run the following:

```python
python3 -m venv .venv # create virtual env
source .venv/bin/activate # use virtual env
```

To play the snake game simply run the `main.py`:

```python
python3 main.py
```

## Tests

Unit tests are located in [tests](./tests/) directory. To run the tests:

```python
pytest test/
```

## Acknowledgments

This application was created as part of [App Brewery's](https://appbrewery.com/) Python Bootcamp.
